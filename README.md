# Weather-App
✅ Weather Forecast Web Application — Project Description

The Weather Forecast Web Application is a modern, responsive, and user-friendly weather dashboard built using React and Vite. It provides real-time and forecasted weather information for any location worldwide using the Visual Crossing Weather API. Designed with a clean dashboard UI, the application focuses on clarity, accessibility, and smooth user experience.

The homepage displays the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, visibility, precipitation probability, and additional highlights such as UV index, sunrise, sunset, and air quality. Users can search for any city, switch between Today and Weekly weather views, and toggle temperature units between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F).

The app dynamically updates its background theme and weather icons based on actual weather conditions (e.g., clear, rain, cloudy, night). It uses React’s state management and hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo) to fetch and display accurate weather data efficiently. Vite ensures extremely fast development build times and seamless hot reloading.

This project demonstrates strong skills in frontend development, API integration, UI/UX design, responsive layout building, and clean component architecture. It is fully optimized for desktops and mobiles, making weather information easily accessible anytime.
